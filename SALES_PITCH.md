# Assignment Pipeline: Sales Pitch for EdTech Partners

---

## The Problem

**Teachers spend countless hours** creating and refining assignments—often without knowing if those assignments are:
- Accessible to all learners (including those with dyslexia, ADHD, visual processing disorders)
- Appropriately challenging for their grade level
- Clear enough for diverse learning styles
- Aligned with higher-order thinking standards

**Result**: Student confusion, lower engagement, unequal outcomes, and teacher burnout.

---

## The Opportunity

**$7.2B ed-tech market** is hungry for tools that improve teaching quality and ensure equitable instruction. Schools are actively investing in:
- Curriculum improvement platforms
- Universal Design for Learning (UDL) compliance tools
- Teacher professional development software
- AI-assisted content creation

**Assignment Pipeline** fills a critical gap: **the only tool that analyzes assignments from an accessibility-first, multi-perspective learning lens.**

## What We Built

### Two Integrated Workflows:
1. **Create**: AI-assisted assignment generation with Bloom's taxonomy alignment

Teachers see exactly how different students will experience their assignment **before it hits the classroom**.

# 📊 Visual Analytics Guide for Teachers

## Overview

The **Philosopher Review** screen includes six interactive visual charts to help you quickly identify improvement opportunities in your assignment. These visualizations work together to show:

- **Where students struggle** (confusion hotspots)
- **Where students get tired** (fatigue progression)
- **Whether topics are balanced** (Bloom coverage)
- **Which sections are risky** (difficulty + fatigue intersections)

---

## The Six Visualizations

### 1. 🔴 **Cluster Heat Map: Student Performance**

#### What It Shows
A color-coded grid showing how students perform on each problem.

- **Green** = Students succeeding (low confusion)
- **Yellow** = Mixed performance (moderate confusion)
- **Red** = Students struggling (high confusion)

#### How to Read It
- Each row is a student persona
- Each column is a problem
- Darker reds indicate higher confusion rates

#### What to Do
**Red areas signal:**
- Unclear problem wording → simplify language
- Prerequisite gap → add scaffolding (examples, hints)
- Novelty mismatch → provide similar worked examples first

**Yellow areas:**
- Students finding it moderately challenging
- Consider adding optional challenge variants for advanced learners
- Or simplify if it's causing too much struggle

### 2. 📈 **Bloom Level vs. Complexity Scatter**

#### What It Shows
Each problem plotted on two dimensions:
- **X-axis (left to right)** = Linguistic complexity (simple → complex vocabulary)
- **Y-axis (bottom to top)** = Cognitive demand (Bloom level: Remember → Create)

Color indicates Bloom level:
- 🔴 Remember (easiest)
- 🟡 Understand
- 🟡 Apply
- 🟢 Analyze
- 🔵 Evaluate
- 🟣 Create (hardest)

#### How to Read It
- **Upper-right quadrant** = Hardest (high Bloom + complex language)
- **Lower-left quadrant** = Easiest (low Bloom + simple language)
- **Scattered distribution** = Good balance across difficulty levels
- **Clustered in one area** = Unbalanced assignment

#### What to Do
**Too many problems in upper-right (high difficulty)?**
- Add scaffolding to difficult problems
- Break multi-part questions into simpler pieces
- Simplify vocabulary in high-demand problems

**Too bunched in one area?**
- Create a few easy warm-up problems
- Create a few harder synthesis problems at the end
- Vary linguistic complexity independent of Bloom level

**Ideal pattern:**
- A few easy starters (lower-left)
- Majority in middle (mixed difficulty)
- A few hard finishers (upper-right)

### 3. 🌡️ **Confusion Density Map: Hotspots**

#### What It Shows
Which student personas struggle most with confusion signals on your assignment.

- **Taller bars** = Higher confusion rates
- **Darker colors** = More intense confusion

#### How to Read It
- One bar per student persona
- Bar height = total confusion signals (summed across all problems)
- A persona with a tall bar may need the assignment to be simpler or more explicitly explained

#### What to Do
**If a specific persona shows high confusion:**

1. **Review problems they struggled with** (from the ranked feedback)
2. **Check for clarity issues:**
   - Is the problem statement clear?
   - Are there multiple interpretations?
   - Do students know what "answer format" is expected (number, sentence, diagram)?

3. **Check for novelty:**
   - Is this problem type new to students?
   - Solution: Add a worked example just before

4. **Check for prerequisites:**
   - Do students have the prior knowledge needed?
   - Solution: Add a brief refresher or prerequisite problem

**Example:**
"Visual Learner" persona shows very high confusion on Problem 5 → Problem 5 likely has unclear diagrams or text-heavy explanations. Try adding a visual example or breaking it into simpler steps.

### 4. ⏱️ **Cumulative Fatigue Curve**

#### What It Shows
How students' mental load (fatigue) grows as they work through your assignment.

- Each colored line = one student persona
- **Flat line** = sustained engagement
- **Steep curve** = rapid fatigue increase

#### How to Read It
- X-axis = progress through assignment (left = start, right = end)
- Y-axis = cumulative fatigue (0 = fresh, 1 = exhausted)

**Shape meanings:**
- **Gradual slope** = Good pacing. Students stay engaged.
- **Steep mid-assignment** = Too hard in the middle. Students burn out.
- **Cliff near end** = Last problems are too demanding after fatigue.
- **Flat then spike** = Sudden difficulty increase.

#### What to Do
**If fatigue curve is too steep:**

1. **Shorten the assignment:** Cut 2-3 problems.
2. **Add a break:** After problem 4, suggest students take a 5-minute break.
3. **Simplify later problems:** The final 3-4 problems should be easier to maintain engagement.
4. **Reorder problems:** Put hard ones in the middle when students are fresher, easier ones at the end.

**If multiple personas show different curves:**
- Some learn slower → need more time, simpler language
- Some are quick → need challenge variants
- Consider offering differentiated versions of difficult problems

### 5. 🎯 **Topic Coverage (Bloom Radar)**

#### What It Shows
A 6-pointed radar chart showing how well your assignment covers each Bloom level:

- **Remember** (recall facts)
- **Understand** (explain concepts)
- **Apply** (use knowledge)
- **Analyze** (break down and compare)
- **Evaluate** (make judgments)
- **Create** (design something new)

#### How to Read It
- Each point represents a Bloom level
- **Lines reaching the outer edge** = good coverage at that level
- **Lines pulled inward** = sparse coverage

**Ideal pattern:** A relatively balanced hexagon (coverage at all Bloom levels).

#### What to Do
**Spotty coverage (uneven hexagon)?**

1. **Identify missing levels:** Which points are too far inward?
2. **Add problems at that level:**
   - Missing "Create"? → Add a design/synthesis problem
   - Missing "Remember"? → Add a fact-recall question
   - Missing "Analyze"? → Add a comparison or breakdown problem

3. **Example:**
Never ask students to "Create" (design) → Students practice up to "Apply" but don't reach higher-order thinking.
**Fix:** Add 1-2 design/project problems.

**All "Remember" and "Understand" (bottom-heavy):**
- Students are not thinking critically
- Move some Understand problems to "Apply" level
- Example: Change "Explain the water cycle" to "Predict what would happen to the water cycle if Earth's temperature increased."

### 6. ⚠️ **Section Risk Assessment Matrix**

#### What It Shows
A 2D grid mapping each section of your assignment:

- **X-axis (left to right)** = Section complexity (simple → complex)
- **Y-axis (bottom to top)** = Student fatigue at that point (fresh → tired)

#### Risk Zones
- 🟢 **Green (lower-left)** = SAFE. Students are fresh and problems are simple.
- 🟡 **Yellow (edges)** = CAUTION. Either complex problems when fresh (manageable) or simple problems when tired (easy recovery).
- 🔴 **Red (upper-right)** = DANGER. Complex problems when students are already tired.

#### How to Read It
Each dot is one problem:
- **Dots in green zone** → no action needed
- **Dots in yellow zone** → monitor, but acceptable
- **Dots in red zone** → needs rewriting

#### What to Do
**Dots in red zone (danger):**

1. **Simplify the problem:**
   - Reduce linguistic complexity
   - Break multi-part questions into separate items
   - Add more guidance (hints, scaffolding)

2. **Move the problem:**
   - Slide it earlier in the assignment (before fatigue sets in)
   - Or follow it with an easier problem to let students recover

3. **Add a checkpoint:**
   - Between the hard problem and the next section
   - Give students a chance to rest, review, or refocus

**Example:**
Problem 8 is in red (hard + students tired) → Solution: Move it to position 4 (before fatigue), or simplify its wording, or add a worked example before it.

## 💡 Tips for Using All Six Charts Together

### Finding Root Causes

**If students are confused on a problem:**
1. Check **Cluster Heat Map** → See which personas struggle
2. Check **Bloom-Complexity Scatter** → Is it because it's hard OR hard + unclear?
3. Check **Confusion Density Map** → Is this a widespread issue?
4. Check **Risk Matrix** → Is it in a dangerous zone (hard + tired)?
5. Check **Fatigue Curve** → Are students already tired at that point?

**If the whole assignment feels off:**
1. Check **Fatigue Curve** → Is pacing bad overall?
2. Check **Topic Radar** → Is coverage balanced?
3. Check **Cluster Heat Map** → Are there widespread weak spots?
4. Check **Risk Matrix** → Are most problems in safe/caution zones?

## 🎓 Interpreting Persona Results

Each visualization shows results for multiple student personas (e.g., "Strong Reader," "ADHD Learner," "Visual Learner").

- **If one persona struggles uniquely** → Problem may need accessibility adjustments for that group
- **If all personas struggle** → Problem is objectively hard or unclear
- **If advanced learners are bored** → Add challenge variants
- **If struggling learners give up** → Add scaffolding

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why does one problem show red in Cluster Heat Map but the Philosopher didn't mention it?
**A:** The Philosopher prioritizes the **highest-impact** fixes. A single bright-red problem affecting one persona may be lower priority than a yellow problem affecting everyone. Check the affected personas—if it's a unique group, consider an accessibility variant.

### Q: The fatigue curve is steep mid-assignment. Should I cut problems?
**A:** First, try reordering: move hardest problems earlier when students are fresh. If that doesn't help, shorten the assignment. Or add checkpoints/breaks.

### Q: My Bloom radar is uneven. Should I balance every level equally?
**A:** Not necessarily. It depends on your learning goals:
- **Introductory course** → More "Remember" and "Understand"
- **Advanced course** → More "Analyze," "Evaluate," "Create"
- **Standards-aligned** → Check your state standards for Bloom distribution

But generally, *some* coverage at every level is better than none.

### Q: The Risk Matrix shows 3 problems in red. Do I have to fix all of them?
**A:** No. Prioritize:
1. Red problems affecting many personas
2. Red problems the Philosopher flagged as high-priority
3. Red problems causing high confusion (Density Map)

Start with those, then tackle others.

### Q: Can I download/print these charts?
**A:** Yes! All charts are embeddable images. You can screenshot, right-click → Save, or use your browser's print function.
